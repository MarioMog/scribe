# Scribe

Scribe is an application that I am building for an academic project, this application will be used to learn to write words in Spanish correctly, it will show you the letters that make up the word to write and through the camera and an AI will detect if the user wrote them correctly.

For this system, I would need to create two APIs, one in nodeJS to get data from the database and the other in python (I haven't decided the framework yet) for the neural network.

| App | Funtionality | Status | Link |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Scribe | It interacts with the user and connects to the other applications. | In process | [Link](https://mariomog.github.io/movert-pagos/) |
| API | It handles the requests from the main application and gets the records from the database. |  | [Link](https://mariomog.github.io/movert-servicios/) |
| IA | Receive the image and determine which letter it resembles |  | [Link](https://mariomog.github.io/movert-app/) |
